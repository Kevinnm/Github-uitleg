# Create a branch.
Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.

By default your repository has one branch named `master` which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to `master`.

When you create a branch off the `master` branch, you’re making a copy, or snapshot, of `master` as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the `master` branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

This diagram shows:

The `master` branch
A new branch called feature (because we’re doing ‘feature work’ on this branch)
The journey that feature takes before it’s merged into `master`

## Create a new branch.
1. Go to your new repository hello-world.
2. Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says branch: `master`.
3. Type a branch name, readme-edits, into the new branch text box.
4. Select the blue Create branch box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.

Now you have two branches, `master` and readme-edits. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we’ll add our changes to the new branch.

# Open a Pull Request.
Now that you have changes in a branch off of `master`, you can open a pull request.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.

### Open a Pull Request for changes to the README
1. Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.	

2. Select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with master (the original).	

3. Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.	diff

4. When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green Create Pull Request button.

5. Give your pull request a title and write a brief description of your changes.	

6. When you’re done with your message, click Create pull request!

# Create new file.
if you click on `Create new file` a new page will showup.
Here you can add text for the new file.
if you finish with the text click `Propose new file`.

# Upload files.
`Upload files` is the same as `Create new file` but in `Upload files` you can add files to your repository with drag and drop.

# Find file.
With `Find file` you can find all files in your repository

# Clone or download
The last button in the navigation bar is `Clone or download`.</br>
With this button you can clone a repository to a editor or a program.
You can also download the repository with Download zip or open in desktop with the GidHub desktop app.

# Congrats!
You finish the navigation bar tutorial!
